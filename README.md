# Data Science Laboratory Works

This repository presents a collection of data science laboratory works completed as part of a Data Science course. 
The projects focus on data science fundamentals, including data aggregation, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and introductory machine learning techniques using Python. 
The labs are based on real-world datasets from Kaggle and demonstrate practical data science skills in working with structured data, handling missing values, building predictive models, and applying unsupervised learning methods.
